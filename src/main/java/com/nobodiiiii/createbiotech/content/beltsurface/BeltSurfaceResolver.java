 *       live hosted surface. The attachment direction comes from
 *       {@link BeltFunnelStateExtensions#ATTACHMENT_SURFACE}, but a result is returned only when the adjacent block
 *       explicitly implements {@link BeltSurfaceProviderBlock} and exposes a matching live
 *       {@link BeltSurfaceHost}. Ordinary Create, magma, and power belts return {@code null} without a block-entity
 *       lookup.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #resolve(BlockGetter, BlockPos, BlockState)} — the same state-encoded lookup when the caller already has
 *       the authoritative state. Geometry and rendering must not call either resolver overload; their transform is
 *       fully determined by the state property and is handled statelessly.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #resolveForPlacement(BlockGetter, BlockPos)} — used only during placement / state-conversion, when the
 *       block at {@code funnelPos} doesn't yet (or no longer) carry a BeltFunnel encoding. Scans the six orthogonal
 *       neighbours for a {@link BeltSurfaceHost} whose outward normal points back at {@code funnelPos}.</li>
